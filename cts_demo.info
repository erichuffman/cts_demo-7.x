// Drupal default features and settings are listed below, but commented out.
// This will result in all of the default features and settings showing up on the
// theme settings page for this theme. If you enabled just one of the features,
// then only that one would show up. However, since disabling the logo, or favicon feature
// causes an error (this is a bug in Drupal, which can be patched
// see: https://www.drupal.org/node/1149900) we'll instead let all of the features load,
// but we'll hide them with CSS (see the theme-settings.php file.)
